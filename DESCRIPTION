Description: Predicts individual race/ethnicity using surname, first name, middle name, geolocation,
    and other attributes, such as gender and age. The method utilizes Bayes'
    Rule (with optional measurement error correction) to compute the posterior probability of each racial category for any given
    individual. The package implements methods described in Imai and Khanna (2016)
    "Improving Ecological Inference by Predicting Individual Ethnicity from Voter
    Registration Records" Political Analysis <DOI:10.1093/pan/mpw001>.
