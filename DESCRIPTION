    Geolocation
Author: Kabir Khanna [aut, cre], Kosuke Imai [aut, cre], Hubert Jin [ctb]
Maintainer: Kabir Khanna <kkhanna@princeton.edu>
Description: Predicts individual race/ethnicity using surname, geolocation, and other 
    attributes, such as gender and age. The method utilizes the Bayes' Rule to compute
    the posterior probability of each racial category for any given individual.
    The package implements methods described in Imai and Khanna (2015) "Improving
    Ecological Inference by Predicting Individual Ethnicity from Voter Registration
    Records" <DOI:10.1093/pan/mpw001>.
