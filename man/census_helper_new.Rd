census_helper_new(
  key = Sys.getenv("CENSUS_API_KEY"),
  voter.file,
  states = "all",

  sex = FALSE,

}
\arguments{
\item{key}{A character string containing a valid Census API key, 
which can be requested from the
[U.S. Census API key signup page](https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html).

By default, attempts to find a census key stored in an
[environment variable][Sys.getenv] named `CENSUS_API_KEY`.}

\item{voter.file}{An object of class \code{data.frame}. Must contain field(s) named
\code{\var{county}}, \code{\var{tract}}, \code{\var{block}}, and/or \code{\var{place}}
specifying geolocation. These should be character variables that match up with
U.S. Census categories. County should be three characters (e.g., "031" not "31"),
tract should be six characters, and block should be four characters.
Place should be five characters if it is included.}

\item{states}{A character vector specifying which states to extract
Census data for, e.g. \code{c("NJ", "NY")}. Default is \code{"all"}, which extracts
Census data for all states contained in user-input data.}

\item{geo}{A character object specifying what aggregation level to use.
Use \code{"county"}, \code{"tract"}, \code{"block"}, or \code{"place"}.
Default is \code{"tract"}. Warning: extracting block-level data takes very long.}

\item{age}{A \code{TRUE}/\code{FALSE} object indicating whether to condition on
age or not. If \code{FALSE} (default), function will return Pr(Geolocation | Race).
If \code{TRUE}, function will return Pr(Geolocation, Age | Race).
If \code{\var{sex}} is also \code{TRUE}, function will return Pr(Geolocation, Age, Sex | Race).}

\item{sex}{A \code{TRUE}/\code{FALSE} object indicating whether to condition on
sex or not. If \code{FALSE} (default), function will return Pr(Geolocation | Race).
If \code{TRUE}, function will return Pr(Geolocation, Sex | Race).
If \code{\var{age}} is also \code{TRUE}, function will return Pr(Geolocation, Age, Sex | Race).}

\item{year}{A character object specifying the year of U.S. Census data to be downloaded.
Use \code{"2010"}, or \code{"2020"}. Default is \code{"2020"}.}

\item{census.data}{A optional census object of class \code{list} containing
pre-saved Census geographic data. Can be created using \code{get_census_data} function.
If \code{\var{census.data}} is provided, the \code{\var{year}} element must
have the same value as the \code{\var{year}} option specified in this function
(i.e., \code{"2010"} in both or \code{"2020"} in both).
If \code{\var{census.data}} is provided, the \code{\var{age}} and the \code{\var{sex}}
elements must be \code{FALSE}. This corresponds to the defaults of \code{census_geo_api}.
If \code{\var{census.data}} is missing, Census geographic data will be obtained via Census API.}

\item{retry}{The number of retries at the census website if network interruption occurs.}

\item{use.counties}{A logical, defaulting to FALSE. Should census data be filtered by counties
available in \var{census.data}?}
}
\value{
Output will be an object of class \code{data.frame}. It will
consist of the original user-input data with additional columns of
Census data.
}
\description{
\code{census_helper_new} links user-input dataset with Census geographic data.
}
\details{
This function allows users to link their geocoded dataset (e.g., voter file)
with U.S. Census data (2010 or 2020). The function extracts Census Summary File data
at the county, tract, block, or place level. Census data calculated are
Pr(Geolocation | Race) where geolocation is county, tract, block, or place.
