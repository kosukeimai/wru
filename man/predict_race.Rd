\arguments{
\item{voter.file}{An object of class \code{data.frame}.
Must contain a row for each individual being predicted,
as well as a field named \code{\var{surname}} containing each individual's surname.
If using geolocation in predictions, \code{\var{voter.file}} must contain a field named
\code{\var{state}}, which contains the two-character abbreviation for each individual's
state of residence (e.g., \code{"nj"} for New Jersey).
If using Census geographic data in race/ethnicity predictions,
\code{\var{voter.file}} must also contain at least one of the following fields:
\code{\var{county}}, \code{\var{tract}}, \code{\var{block_group}}, \code{\var{block}},
and/or \code{\var{place}}.
These fields should contain character strings matching U.S. Census categories.
County is three characters (e.g., \code{"031"} not \code{"31"}),
tract is six characters, block group is usually a single character and block
is four characters. Place is five characters.
See below for other optional fields.}

\item{census.surname}{A \code{TRUE}/\code{FALSE} object. If \code{TRUE},
function will call \code{merge_surnames} to merge in Pr(Race | Surname)
from U.S. Census Surname List (2000, 2010, or 2020) and Spanish Surname List.
If \code{FALSE}, user must provide a \code{name.dictionary} (see below).
Default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{surname.only}{A \code{TRUE}/\code{FALSE} object. If \code{TRUE}, race predictions will
only use surname data and calculate Pr(Race | Surname). Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{census.geo}{An optional character vector specifying what level of
geography to use to merge in U.S. Census geographic data. Currently
\code{"county"}, \code{"tract"}, \code{"block_group"}, \code{"block"}, and \code{"place"}
are supported.
Note: sufficient information must be in user-defined \code{\var{voter.file}} object.
If \code{\var{census.geo} = "county"}, then \code{\var{voter.file}}
must have column named \code{county}.
If \code{\var{census.geo} = "tract"}, then \code{\var{voter.file}}
must have columns named \code{county} and \code{tract}.
And if \code{\var{census.geo} = "block"}, then \code{\var{voter.file}}
must have columns named \code{county}, \code{tract}, and \code{block}.
If \code{\var{census.geo} = "place"}, then \code{\var{voter.file}}
must have column named \code{place}.
Specifying \code{\var{census.geo}} will call \code{census_helper} function
to merge Census geographic data at specified level of geography.}

\item{census.key}{A character object specifying user's Census API
key. Required if \code{\var{census.geo}} is specified, because
a valid Census API key is required to download Census geographic data.}

\item{census.data}{A list indexed by two-letter state abbreviations,
which contains pre-saved Census geographic data.
Can be generated using \code{get_census_data} function.}

\item{age}{An optional \code{TRUE}/\code{FALSE} object specifying whether to
condition race predictions on age (in addition to surname and geolocation).
Default is \code{FALSE}. Must be same as \code{\var{age}} in \code{\var{census.data}} object.
May only be set to \code{TRUE} if \code{census.geo} option is specified.
If \code{TRUE}, \code{\var{voter.file}} should include a numerical variable \code{\var{age}}.}

\item{sex}{optional \code{TRUE}/\code{FALSE} object specifying whether to
condition race predictions on sex (in addition to surname and geolocation).
Default is \code{FALSE}. Must be same as \code{\var{sex}} in \code{\var{census.data}} object.
May only be set to \code{TRUE} if \code{census.geo} option is specified.
If \code{TRUE}, \code{\var{voter.file}} should include a numerical variable \code{\var{sex}},
where \code{\var{sex}} is coded as 0 for males and 1 for females.}

\item{year}{An optional character vector specifying the year of U.S. Census geographic
data to be downloaded. Use \code{"2010"}, or \code{"2020"}. Default is \code{"2020"}.}

\item{party}{An optional character object specifying party registration field
in \code{\var{voter.file}}, e.g., \code{\var{party} = "PartyReg"}.
If specified, race/ethnicity predictions will be conditioned
on individual's party registration (in addition to geolocation).
Whatever the name of the party registration field in \code{\var{voter.file}},
it should be coded as 1 for Democrat, 2 for Republican, and 0 for Other.}

\item{retry}{The number of retries at the census website if network interruption occurs.}

\item{impute.missing}{Logical, defaults to TRUE. Should missing be imputed?}

\item{use.counties}{A logical, defaulting to FALSE. Should census data be filtered by counties
available in \var{census.data}?}

\item{model}{Character string, either "BISG" (default) or "fBISG" (for error-correction,
fully-Bayesian model).}

\item{race.init}{Vector of initial race for each observation in voter.file.
Must be an integer vector, with 1=white, 2=black, 3=hispanic, 4=asian, and
5=other. Defaults to values obtained using \code{model="BISG_surname"}.}

\item{name.dictionaries}{Optional named list of \code{data.frame}'s
containing counts of names by race. Any of the following named elements
are allowed: "surname", "first", "middle". When present, the objects must
follow the same structure as \code{last_c}, \code{first_c},
\code{mid_c}, respectively.}

\item{names.to.use}{One of 'surname', 'surname, first', or  'surname, first,
middle'. Defaults to 'surname'.}

\item{control}{List of control arguments only used when \code{model="fBISG"}, including
\itemize{
\item{iter}{ Number of MCMC iterations. Defaults to 1000.}
\item{burnin}{ Number of iterations discarded as burnin. Defaults to half of \code{iter}.}
\item{verbose}{ Print progress information. Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}
\item{me.correct}{ Boolean. Should the model correcting measurement error for \code{races|geo}? Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}
\item{seed}{ RNG seed. If \code{NULL}, a seed is generated and returned as an attribute for reproducibility.}
}}
}
\value{
Output will be an object of class \code{data.frame}. It will
consist of the original user-input \code{voter.file} with additional columns with
predicted probabilities for each of the five major racial categories:
\code{\var{pred.whi}} for White,
\code{\var{pred.bla}} for Black,
\code{\var{pred.his}} for Hispanic/Latino,
\code{\var{pred.asi}} for Asian/Pacific Islander, and
\code{\var{pred.oth}} for Other/Mixed.
}
\description{
\code{predict_race} makes probabilistic estimates of individual-level race/ethnicity.
}
\details{
This function implements the Bayesian race prediction methods outlined in
Imai and Khanna (2015). The function produces probabilistic estimates of
individual-level race/ethnicity, based on surname, geolocation, and party.
